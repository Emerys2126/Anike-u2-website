    <img class="about-band-image" src="images/U2 on Tour.jpg" alt="u2 Band" >
    <p> U2, the iconic Irish rock band from Dublin, was formed in 1976 by Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr. Their musical journey began with limited proficiency, but they soon signed with Island Records and released their debut album, "Boy," in 1980. The band's politically and socially conscious themes gained recognition with albums like "War" (1983), featuring hits like "Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Pride (In the Name of Love)." </p>

<p>"The Joshua Tree" marked their international breakthrough, becoming one of the best-selling albums ever, with hits "With or Without You" and "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For." In the 1990s, U2 embraced alternative rock and electronic influences, reinventing themselves with albums like "Achtung Baby" and multimedia-intensive tours like Zoo TV. </p>
      

    <p>Despite mixed success with "Pop" (1997), they regained acclaim with "All That You Can't Leave Behind" (2000) and "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" (2004), showcasing a more mainstream sound. Their U2 360° Tour in 2009 set records for attendance and revenue. In the 2010s, they released "Songs of Innocence" (2014) and "Songs of Experience" (2017), the former garnering attention for its unconventional release on iTunes. </p>

<p>Their most recent album, "Songs of Surrender" (2023), features reimagined versions of 40 songs from their career. U2 has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time." </p>

<p>Throughout their career, U2 has been dedicated to human rights and social justice causes, working with organizations like Amnesty International, Product Red, and War Child. Their impact on music and culture is immense, and their music continues to resonate with audiences globally.</p>

<p>U2 received their first Grammy Award in 1988 for The Joshua Tree, and they have won 22 in total out of 46 nominations, more than any other group. These include Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rock Album. In the UK, U2 have received 7 Brit Awards out of 20 nominations from the British Phonographic Industry, including five wins for Best International Group. They were the first international group to win the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In Ireland, U2 have won 14 Meteor Awards since the awards began in 2001. Other awards won by the band and their members include one American Music Award, six MTV Video Music Awards, eleven Q Awards, two Juno Awards, five NME Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2005. In 2006, all four members of the band received ASCAP awards for writing the songs "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "Vertigo". In 2022, the group received Kennedy Center Honors for their contributions in the performing arts, making them only the fifth musical group to be so honoured.
